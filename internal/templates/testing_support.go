// SetFSForTest replaces the registered template filesystems with exactly the
// ones given, for the duration of the calling test, and restores the prior
// registrations via t.Cleanup. Exported (like configs.SetConfigForTest) so a
// package outside templates that needs Process to actually read real
// on-disk templates in a test (rather than the untouched, empty-fileSystems
// default) can get that without permanently leaking a RegisterFS call into
// every later test sharing the same test binary process.
//
// RegisterFS only appends and has no matching unregister: once called, its
// filesystem stays registered for the rest of that test binary's run. That
// matters because readFile's zero-registrations behavior is not "always
// fail" but "always vacuously succeed with zero bytes" (see the comment on
// TestMain in process_test.go), which many callers across the codebase rely
// on in tests that never set up a real templates filesystem or a matching
// FilePaths.DataFiles. A single unscoped RegisterFS call flips that default
// for everything downstream in the same run, so anything that needs a real,
// disk-backed render in one test must use this instead.
