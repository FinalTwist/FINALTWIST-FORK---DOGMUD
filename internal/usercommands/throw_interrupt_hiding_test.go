// TestThrowInterruptAudienceNamesTheActee proves the cast-interrupt event's
// Audience carries the mob's name, so SendTrio can hide it from a reader who
// cannot see.
//
// throw is area-effect and genuinely actee-less, so it builds ONE Audience with
// ActeeName: NoName and reuses it for every event. player_cast_interrupt is the
// exception: it renders a single mob's name into throw.yaml's {actee_plain}.
// NoName means "nobody to hide" at trio.go:127 and hidenames.go:48, so before
// this fix the mob's name reached every reader at every sight tier.
