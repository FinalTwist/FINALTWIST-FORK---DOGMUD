// File: craft_missing_tag_storage_test.go
//
// 🐛 Prod defect, owner 2026-09-21. `craft setting` answered "You are
// missing: copper-wire." to a player holding 39 Copper Wire in their bank.
//
// The pull is all-or-nothing by owner ruling, so a shortfall storage cannot
// fully cover moves nothing at all. Every refusal below it was then written
// from crafting.HasIngredients, which only ever sees what is CARRIED and
// names the first short tag in recipe order. chrysalis-setting lists
// copper-wire first, so the player was sent to fetch the one component they
// had in quantity. The real blocker was chrysalis-shard, listed second and
// absent everywhere.
//
// These tests use the shipped recipe's shape: ingredient A listed first and
// sitting in storage, ingredient B listed second and held nowhere.

// bank can supply listed FIRST. No station and no skill floor, so the only
// gate this recipe can fail is the ingredient check.
