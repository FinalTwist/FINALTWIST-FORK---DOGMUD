// Dismiss severs the player's bond with a companion.
// Behavior depends on how the companion came to be bound:
//   - Charmed (wild animal charmed via the charm spell): the bond-break
//     is thematically a betrayal — the mob turns hostile and remains in
//     the world as a natural mob.
//   - Summoned / Conjured / Raised (companions the player created):
//     these are mage-crafted beings, not independent creatures. Dismiss
//     dissolves them peacefully — no aggro, immediate despawn.
//   - Bonded (driven by the aicompanion module): refused while the module
//     drives it, since parting ways is companion-part's business. With the
//     module switched off it parts peacefully and despawns.
//
// publishReleasedReservation republishes the player's vitals after a companion
// record has been removed.
//
// A fielded companion holds a slice of its owner's Conviction, and
// Char.Vitals carries that figure to the web client as conviction_reserved.
// Nothing else on the dismiss path emits an event, and Char.Vitals is a
// push-only snapshot, so without this the client kept showing a phantom
// reservation for a companion that no longer exists. The prompt bar and
// `status` never had the bug because both read GetPoolReservation live.
//
// It could not be left to the regen tick to correct, either.
// NewRound_AutoHeal only republishes when health actually moved OR when the
// player still has at least one companion, so dismissing the LAST one at full
// health is exactly the case that never self-corrects, and the phantom
// survives until something else happens to the character.
