// File: look_exit_visibility_test.go
//
// Graded lighting arc, plan 1 Task 5: look.go now reads two different
// thresholds off the same LightLevel() value. LightBlindBelow gates seeing
// the room at all; LightExitsAbove separately gates seeing THROUGH an exit.
// The parity golden (lighting_parity_golden_test.go) only covers sight
// tiers, not exit-peering, so this is the one automated check for the
// look.go:258 site.
//
// TestLookExit_RoomOnlyLightBlocksExitPeering pins the band the old model
// could not name explicitly: light enough to see the room (at or above
// LightBlindBelow, default 25) but not enough to see down an exit (below
// LightExitsAbove, default 65). The old model expressed this exact band as
// visibility 1: enough to pass the "can't see anything" gate but not the
// "too dark to see anything in that direction" gate.
//
// 🔑 Since graded lighting plan 3a Task 8, LightLevel() composes a
// continuous value rather than landing on one of three named points, so the
// fixture is asserted against the BAND (the property this test actually
// needs), not a fixed constant. A dark biome (cave, sky fraction 0) plus one
// carried light source lands exactly on LightDimBelow (the model lifts a lit
// room to the bottom of the "room readable, exits not" band; see
// internal/rooms/lighting.go's lightLevelWithMutatorBridge, term 4), which is
// inside the band asserted below by construction.
