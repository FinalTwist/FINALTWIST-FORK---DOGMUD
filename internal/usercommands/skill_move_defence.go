// sendMoveDefenceTriad was the outlier: it bundled rendering with sending, so a
// caller whose room line was CONDITIONAL on a defence having spoken had to
// split one narrated event across two sends, because asking the question also
// answered it. Separating them lets every caller build one Trio.
//
// ok is false when the outcome was not a defence (e.g. a fumbled swing that
// had actually won its roll); the caller then falls back to its plain miss
// text. It is NOT false for a missing pool: as of 2026-08-31
// combat.RenderChannelDefenceMessages substitutes generic narration, so a
// defended outcome always speaks. Do not reintroduce a pool check here.

// (internal/messaging/pipeline.go:59), so this line is hidden here or not at
// all -- that is the reason trio.go's own docstring names this file as the
// sanctioned exception to "callers hand SendTrio finished text and nothing
// more": text handed to SendTrio here has already been hidden by the reader's
// three-tier sight verdict.
//
// This reads the same shared messaging.ParticipantSight verdict as the
// mob-attacker copy of this helper (internal/mobcommands/skill_move_defence.go);
// the two used to diverge on a binary canSeeInDark predicate until this task
// collapsed them onto the shared verdict.
//
// sourceName is the attacker's BARE name (no ansi tag): every call site
// already has it as user.Character.Name.
