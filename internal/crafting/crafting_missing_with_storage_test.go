// The prod defect this file pins (owner, 2026-09-21):
//
// `craft setting` answered "You are missing: copper-wire." while 39 Copper
// Wire sat in the player's bank. PlanStoragePull is all-or-nothing by owner
// ruling, so a shortfall it cannot fully cover pulls NOTHING, and the refusal
// was then written from HasIngredients, which only ever sees what is carried.
// copper-wire is the recipe's FIRST ingredient, so it is the first tag that
// check comes up short on, and the player was named the one component they
// had plenty of. The real blocker was chrysalis-shard, listed second and
// absent everywhere.
//
// The two tests below are the chrysalis-setting case reduced to its shape:
// ingredient A listed first and covered by storage, ingredient B listed
// second and absent.

// chrysalisShapedRecipe mirrors the shipped chrysalis-setting recipe's
// ingredient list, which is the only part of it this defect depends on.
