// A player's pickpocket of an NPC takes a moment (docs/baubles, Phase 6a):
//
//  1. The contest is rolled AT ONCE (stealFromMob), and the player is told
//     only "You attempt to pick X's pocket...".
//  2. On a success, the NPC's own bauble is marked to be taken; an NPC
//     carrying none turns one up BaublePickpocketChancePct of the time, and
//     its naming starts now (baubles.Generate, off the lock), so the pause
//     pays for the model call.
//  3. The pause is StealPocketSeconds at Dexterity 100, scaled by
//     100/Dexterity (quicker hands are faster) and held between
//     StealPocketMinSeconds and StealPocketMaxSeconds (PocketDelay).
//  4. When it ends (and a naming not back yet has had up to
//     BaublePickpocketGraceSecs more), the outcome is revealed under the mud
//     lock: the loot, the bauble among it, with the ordinary success line
//     (takeFromMob); or being caught (caughtByMob).
//
// A failed roll is caught however the pause ends (owner ruling
// 2026-09-29): with the thief and the mark both still in the theft room,
// in the act; otherwise, or offline, the mark cries thief in its room and
// the crime is recorded in the theft room, with the mark its only witness;
// the mark reveals and attacks only a thief it is beside now (caught). A
// successful roll whose thief has left the room, logged off or started
// fighting by then, or whose mark has gone, loses the chance: nothing is
// taken. A bauble already named for it stays in the mark's pocket, to be
// found by the next attempt. Pickpocketed baubles are pocket-sized: the
// prompt says so (modules/baubles, size_rule) and the catalog clamps their
// weight (baubles.MaxWeightFor).
//
// Every attempt is tracked from the moment it starts, so a copyover or
// shutdown finishes it (FlushPocketAttempts) rather than losing it.
