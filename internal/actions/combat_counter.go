package actions

// U6b Task 10 — the counter tier's actions-side wiring.
//
// Three entry points live here:
//
//   - counterSkillMoveExit: fires combat.ExecuteCounter at every
//     single-target ExecuteSkillMove consumer's defensive-crit exit (the
//     special moves and ExecuteFire; the area drain has none, because an
//     area attack earns no counter). It refuses results produced under
//     IsCounter, so melee's auto-trip/auto-bash (which ride the seam AS
//     counters) can never chain.
//   - FireCounterTaunt: exported. The one defy dispatch, shared by taunt's
//     counterTauntExit below and the spell exit in internal/hooks, for a
//     defied charm. A defy crit COUNTER-TAUNTS instead of counter-swinging,
//     and the wiring lives HERE (not in internal/combat) because taunt
//     resolution needs this package and internal/combat can never import
//     it.
//   - executeCounterTaunt (beneath FireCounterTaunt): the defy carve-out's
//     cost-free contest and damage primitive, called by FireCounterTaunt.
//
// Narration is channel-correct (U6b Task 11), rendered by internal/combat
// from the counter-* pools in defense-messages/. SEQUENCING (the Task 10 wart,
// fixed by Task 11): counterSkillMoveExit does NOT dispatch — the counter
// would print before the move's own outcome, because messages render in call
// order and the wrappers narrate AFTER ExecuteX returns. Instead the
// CounterResult rides up on the action's result struct, and the command
// wrapper calls DispatchCounterMessages after its own outcome text — the same
// flow the defence triads use. The defy counter-taunt has always dispatched
// straight from FireCounterTaunt (Task 10's review flagged only the
// skill-move ordering; the taunt path was accepted as-is at the time), and
// its narration comes from the counter-defy pool via
// combat.BuildCounterTauntMessages.

//
//   - NO special-move cooldown: neither checked nor consumed. ExecuteTaunt's
//     CooldownReady/TryCooldown pair is for paid, chosen actions; a counter

// so a defy crit against the counter-taunt ends the chain.
