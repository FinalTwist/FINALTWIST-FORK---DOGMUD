// TestPreformattedCategoriesPassThroughUnwrapped pins the CONSEQUENCE
// of shouldWrap's allowlist (pipeline.go), not its policy. Task 4's
// tests (pipeline_test.go's TestShouldWrapMatchesPinnedAllowlist and
// friends) already pin which categories the switch admits. This test
// exists because an allowlist can be correct in isolation and still
// let a real payload shape through mangled if nobody ever ran one
// through it.
//
// Five shapes are run through RenderForRecipient at LineWidth: 20,
// far narrower than any fixture's content, so the wrap stage would
// have every reason to fire if it were mistakenly admitted:
//
//  1. CategorySystem    - a column table (inventory-style listing).
//  2. CategoryBroadcast - a box-drawn banner, using the box-drawing
//     characters as in usercommands/motd.go's frame.
//  3. CategoryRoomDescription - a side-by-side block: prose on the
//     left, a minimap column on the right, separated by a vertical bar.
//  4. CategorySplash - small ASCII art.
//  5. CategorySkillProgress - a progress banner.
//
// These are SHAPES, not live renders: internal/messaging sits below
// internal/templates and internal/usercommands in the import graph
// and cannot call the real template/command code that produces these
// screens. Task 7 closes that gap with a root-package test that
// renders real production templates; this test is not sufficient by
// itself, only a guard against the wrap stage specifically.
//
// Why not byte equality (if got != fixture.text): it would fail on
// all five fixtures here, for two reasons that are legitimate pipeline
// behavior and out of scope for a wrap guard:
//
//   - applyCategoryColor (pipeline.go) wraps every category except
//     CategoryDefault in `<ansi fg="...">...</ansi>`. All five
//     categories below are non-default, so all five gain a tag.
//   - skipStages (normalize.go) exempts CategoryRoomDescription,
//     CategorySplash and CategorySkillProgress from normalization, but
//     NOT CategorySystem or CategoryBroadcast. Those two additionally
//     get a sentence-ending period appended to their last line by
//     appendEndPunct.
//
// Neither of those is the wrap stage's doing, and fixing them (for
// example, exempting CategorySystem from normalization) is explicitly
// out of scope here: it would disable capitalization across roughly
// 1975 refusal sites to protect a few dozen tables, and is filed as
// its own follow-up.
//
// So this test asserts what the wrap guard is actually for. Wrapping
// damages pre-formatted text in exactly two ways:
//
//  1. It folds long lines, changing the line count.
//  2. It collapses runs of padding spaces, destroying column alignment
//     WITHOUT changing the line count (WrapAnsi rejoins words with a
//     single space regardless of how many spaces separated them in the
//     source). A real table once went from 494 bytes to 436 at width
//     55 with its newline count unchanged, so a line-count check alone
//     would have passed while the table was ruined.
//
// Both are asserted for every fixture:
//
//   - the rendered output has the same number of lines as the fixture
//     text, and
//   - every line of the fixture text still appears verbatim as a
//     substring of the rendered output, which proves internal padding
//     runs survived (a folded or space-collapsed line could not
//     contain the original line as a substring).
//
// Channel is ChannelAudio throughout: this test is about wrap, not
// about the sight gate, and audio ignores SightDecision entirely.
