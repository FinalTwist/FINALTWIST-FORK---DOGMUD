// TestRoomIsLit pins Task 6a's new room-level predicate: IsLit() is true iff
// the room's CURRENT LightLevel() is at or above LightBlindBelow. It is
// defined purely against LightLevel, so this test deliberately reuses the
// same two fixtures TestLightLevelMapsTheOldModel already proves land on
// LightDark and LightFull, rather than asserting anything new about the
// light model itself.
//
// See TestLightLevelMapsTheOldModel's doc comment above for why Timing and
// the round count must both be pinned explicitly (gametime.IsNight() and
// GetBiome() otherwise read ambient test-binary state), and why
// gametime.ClearDateCacheForTest() is called before sampling: the
// round->date cache is keyed only on the round number, not on Timing
// config, so a round another test in this package already asked about would
// silently return that test's answer instead of being recomputed here.

// TestLightLevelMapsTheOldModel is RETIRED as of Task 8.
//
// It pinned the mapping that made graded lighting plan 1 behaviour
// preserving: every shipped room landing on one of exactly three values
// (LightDark/LightRoomOnly/LightFull), computed from legacyVisibility. Task 8
// deletes legacyVisibility and those three constants on purpose: LightLevel
// now composes a continuous value from the celestial term, the room's sky
// fraction and lamp, and any carried light, so there is no fixed three-point
// mapping left to assert. Coverage for "a cave stays dark" and "a fully open
// room reads lit" moves to TestRoomIsLit below (behaviour, not exact value)
// and to internal/rooms/lighting_model_test.go (the model's arithmetic
// directly). The day-cycle golden (lighting_daycycle_golden_test.go, package
// main) is what now guards the model's actual numbers room-for-room.
