// Bonded companions (characters.CompanionBonded) are driven by the
// aicompanion module. They differ from every other companion kind in one way
// that matters here: their death is not the end of them. The record stays on
// the owner, the mind the module keeps for them survives, and they recover.
//
// What they lose on death is what any character loses: everything they were
// carrying, wearing and holding goes to the corpse through the normal mob
// loot path (dropMobLootAndSetCorpse), and the owner can recover it from
// there. Clearing the snapshot here is what keeps that from duplicating
// items: if the saved Items survived, the companion would respawn holding
// the same gear that is also lying in the corpse.

// instead of removing the record. Called from CompanionCleanup.
