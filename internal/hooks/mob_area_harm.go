// A bonded companion harms only what her owner could harm. The aicompanion
// module checks that when she starts a harmful spell (harmAllowed,
// areaHarmAllowed), but an area spell folds over several rounds and lands on
// whoever is in the room when it resolves, not whoever was there when she
// began. So an area harm spell cast by a bonded companion is checked again
// here, at resolution, against each target, asked as her owner: a creature
// by mobs.CheckPlayerHarm (as a player's own area spell is,
// playerHarmTargetPermitted), a person by (*rooms.Room).CanPvp with her owner
// as the attacker and not a member of her owner's party.
//
// The engine's own functions answer, with the owner read off the charm
// (GetCharmedUserId), so no seam is needed; companionai.IsBondedCompanion
// says whether the caster is bonded and is false while the module is off,
// when a bonded companion is an ordinary one and nothing changes.

// mobAreaHarmTargets is who a mob's area harm spell lands on when it
// resolves: every creature in the room but itself and non-combatants, and
// every person. A charmed caster spares its owner and its owner's other
// companions; a bonded one also spares whatever its owner could not harm.
