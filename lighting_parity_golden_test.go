// TestLightingParityAcrossEveryShippedRoom was the behaviour-preservation
// proof for graded lighting plan 1. It records, for every shipped room, what
// each kind of observer can see and whether exits are visible.
//
// 🔴 RETIRED as of plan 3a Task 10. It was recorded against the unmodified
// tree and had to come back byte identical through plans 1 and 2, because
// those plans only swapped the SCALE the old three-value model reported on,
// not what any room actually showed a player. Plan 3a is the opposite: it
// deliberately changes what is lit, replacing legacyVisibility with sun,
// moons, season and a per-biome sky fraction. There is no "unmodified tree"
// left to preserve, so this file is re-recorded here as the POST-change
// state, not diffed against a pre-change one.
//
// testdata/lighting_daycycle.golden (lighting_daycycle_golden_test.go) is now
// the guard for lighting behaviour: it is explicitly allowed to move, but
// only with its diff's shape proven first (see that test's own failure
// message). This file remains useful as a snapshot of what every room shows
// every kind of observer today, and still catches an accidental change
// between two runs of an unrelated PR, but a change here is no longer, on its
// own, evidence of a defect.
//
// The four observer kinds are the ones ParticipantSight actually branches on
// (internal/messaging/predicates.go:51-68): an ordinary character, one
// carrying NightVision (condition 29), one carrying InfraredVision
// (condition 85), and one that is Blinded (condition 3).
//
// The blinded fixture is condition 3, not a hand-set flag: ParticipantSight
// tests observer.Perception.State() == perception.Blinded, the Perception
// state machine, not a condition flag directly.
// Character.AddCondition (internal/characters/conditions.go:116-129) drives
// that transition itself when conditionId == perception.ConditionIdBlinded
// (3) and the machine is currently Sighted, so AddCondition(3, true) is the
// real path. Verified live: TestParticipantSight's table
// (internal/messaging/participant_sight_test.go:45) exercises the Blinded
// branch, and a throwaway probe built during this task (built the same way
// this fixture is built, then run against a definitely-lit room) asserted
// SightNone, then was sabotaged (swapped condition 3 for condition 29) and
// confirmed the assertion goes red naming the right condition before being
// restored. See the task report for the full transcript; the probe file
// itself was not committed.
