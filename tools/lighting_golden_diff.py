"""Group a lighting golden's diff by sample section and biome.

Read-only. Never writes a golden; it only explains one that moved.

    python tools/lighting_golden_diff.py <before> <after>

<before> may be a git ref-ish path, in which case pipe it in yourself:

    git show HEAD:testdata/lighting_daycycle.golden > before.tmp
    python tools/lighting_golden_diff.py before.tmp testdata/lighting_daycycle.golden

Every golden move in the graded lighting arc must be explained room-for-room
before it is re-recorded. A move you cannot account for is a defect, however
plausible the totals look.
