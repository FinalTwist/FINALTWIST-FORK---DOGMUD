// tokenEngineAllowed lists the only production files outside
// internal/narration that may hand a brace-delimited string literal to the
// strings.Replace family, with why. An entry here must be a NON-narration use
// of braces: a shell or SQL fragment, a JSON skeleton, a filesystem template.
// It must never read "this store renders its own tokens" -- that is precisely
// the second engine this guard exists to stop.
//
// EMPTY as of M4a task 8, and correctly so: production Go under internal/ and
// modules/ holds 59 strings.Replace/ReplaceAll/NewReplacer calls, exactly one
// of which is inside internal/narration (render.go's NewReplacer, the engine).
// Of the other 58 not one passes a literal containing "{" -- they replace
// underscores with spaces, CRLF with LF, quotes, ansi tags and zone-name
// separators. Adding an entry is a
// design decision to be argued in review; weakening the matcher is not an
// option. Both directions of this map were exercised when the guard was
// proven capable of failing -- see the header comment on TestNoSecondTokenEngine.
var tokenEngineAllowed = map[string]string{}

// TestNoSecondTokenEngine fails when any file outside internal/narration
// substitutes a brace token by hand. The messaging arc promised this guard in
// its "How we know it worked" list and never built it; three engines survived
// M0 to M3 as a result (items.SetTokenValue, grapplemessaging.RenderTemplate,
// hooks.substitute), each rendering the same stores through different code.
//
// It matches a call to strings.Replace, strings.ReplaceAll or
// strings.NewReplacer where any argument is a string literal containing "{".
// The walk is over the whole *ast.File, so the package-level
// `var x = strings.NewReplacer("{actor}", ...)` form is covered as well as
// calls inside function bodies: a var declaration's value is an expression
// like any other.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT CLAIM. It recognises the strings.Replace family and
// nothing else, so a second engine built on regexp.ReplaceAllString with a
// `\{...\}` pattern, on bytes.Replace, or on a hand-written index scan over a
// strings.Builder would pass unnoticed. That is a deliberate, narrow matcher
// rather than an oversight: all three engines this arc actually deleted were
// strings.Replace-shaped, and a wider net would have to be argued against the
// 13 regexp-replacement sites under internal/ that are all legitimately
// non-narration (ansi tags, <name> tags, filename sanitising, a/an
// normalisation). A false claim of total coverage would be worse than this
// stated gap.
//
// Two token engines survive by design and are NOT matched, for different
// reasons:
//
//   - internal/narration itself, skipped by path. It is the one engine.
//   - internal/users/userrecord.prompt.go, the status-prompt engine. It is a
//     regexp (`\{[a-zA-Z%:\-]+\}`) plus a switch over a different vocabulary
//     ({hp}, {mp}, {tnl}), it renders a HUD rather than narration, and it
//     holds no strings.Replace call at all, so the matcher never reaches it.
//
// PROVEN CAPABLE OF FAILING. A scratch internal/hooks/zz_sabotage.go holding
// `strings.ReplaceAll(s, "{actor}", name)` was confirmed to compile under
// `go vet ./internal/hooks/` and then confirmed to turn this test red by name
// and line. The allowlist path was exercised in the same session: with the
// sabotage still present and its file registered in tokenEngineAllowed the
// test went green again, and with the entry left behind after the sabotage
// was deleted the test went red as stale. Re-verify the same three ways after
// any change to the matcher; a green run from a blind matcher proves nothing.
